            Google, which held its developer conference I/O 2022 late
            Wednesday, has doubled down on artificial intelligence (AI) and
            machine learning (ML) development. It is focusing not only on
            research, but also product development. One of Google's focus
            areas is making its products, especially those involving
            communication, more ‚Äúnuanced and natural‚Äù. This includes
            development and deployment of new language processing models.
            After launching LaMDA (Language Model for Dialog Applications)
            last year, which allowed Google Assistant to have more natural
            conversations, Google has announced LaMDA 2 and the AI Test
            Kitchen, which is an app that will bring access to this model to
            users.........

            Consumer electronics major Samsung on Tuesday launched its range
            of artificial intelligence-enabled bilingual AI EcoBubble fully
            automatic front load washing machines in India. The 2022 line up
            of 40 models comes with intelligent features such as AI wash, air
            wash technology and super speed cycle, Samsung said in a
            statement. ''AI EcoBubble is India's first washing machine that
            learns user behaviour and suggests the most preferred wash cycle,
            providing ease of use by eliminating the need to juggle through
            multiple options,'' said Samsung. This smart Internet of Things
            (IoT)-enabled washing machine line up can be connected with
            Samsung smart devices such as Galaxy smartphones, Samsung smart
            TVs and family hub refrigerators as well as voice devices such as
            Alexa and Google Home, it added.........

            Good data‚Äîand lots of it‚Äîis key to making artificial
            intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) production, inspection and
            packaging systems work without a hitch, plus well written
            algorithms to analyze the data and make decisions that will help
            people and machines function more intelligently. In fact, 3-D
            vision systems are usually the ‚Äúeyes‚Äù robots use to guide them as
            they sort and package products or load pallets‚Äî3-D because it
            provides much more data to make intelligent decisions
            quickly.Processors are keenly interested in getting their products
            perfect before packaging, and AI/ML can play a part in production
            monitoring......
